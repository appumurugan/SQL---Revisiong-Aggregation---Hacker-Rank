Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken 
until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeroes removed), 
and the actual average salary. Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.actual - miscalculated:  average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.
select "(" + Convert(Varchar(3),ID) + ",'" + Name + "'," + Convert(Varchar(10),Salary) + ")," from Employees
